# Running a Network Node

This project lets you set up a local read-only replica of the Optimistic Ethereum chain (either the main one or the Kovan testnet). [New 
transactions are submitted either to the sequencer outside of Ethereum or to the Canonical Transaction Chain on 
L1](https://research.paradigm.xyz/optimism#data-availability-batches), so submitting transactions to an L2 replica does not make sense.

## Architecture

You need two components to replicate Optimistic Ethereum:

- `data-transport-layer`, which retrieves and indexes blocks from L1. To access L1 you need an Ethereum Layer 1 provider, such as 
  [Infura](https://infura.io/).

- `l2geth`, which provides an Ethereum node where you applications can connect and run API calls.


## Software Packages

These packages are required to run the replica:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
1. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

In addition, if you want to run the sync test, you need:

3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), version 12 or later
4. [Classic Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)


## Configuration

To configure the project, clone this repository and copy the `env.example` file to `.env`.
Set `L1_RPC_ENDPOINT` in the `.env` file to your Ethereum Layer1 RPC provider (local node, Infura, etc.)

### Docker Image Versions

We recommend using the latest versions of both docker images. Find them as GitHub tags 
[here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tags) and as published Docker images linked in the badges:

## Usage

- Start the replica:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

- Get the logs for `l2geth`:
  ```sh
  docker logs op-replica_l2geth_1 
  ```

- Get the logs for `data-transport-layer`:
  ```sh
  docker logs op-replica_dtl_1
  ```

- Stop the replica:
  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```


## Sync Check

To make sure your replica is running correctly, we've provided a script that checks its state roots against our sequencer.

```
yarn
npx ts-node src/sync-check.ts
```

You can also run this sync check as an express server that exposes metrics:
```
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

## Transaction-write latency Check

We've also provided a script to test a replica endpoint's transaction latency.

```
yarn
npx ts-node src/tx-latency.ts
```
